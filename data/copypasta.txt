Upstream, this software supports Python 3. Please provide a Python 3
package for Fedora.


According to the Python packaging guidelines [0], software must be
packaged for Python 3 if upstream supports it.
The guidelines give detailed information on how to do this, and even
provide an example spec file [1].

The current best practice is to provide subpackages for the two Python
versions (called "Common SRPM" in the guidelines). Alternatively, if
nothing depends on your Python2 package, you can just switch to Python 3
entirely.

It's OK to do this in Rawhide only, however, it would be greatly
appreciated if you could push it to Fedora 24 as well.


If you need more instructions, a guide for porting Python-based RPMs is
available at [2].
If anything is unclear, or if you need any kind of assistance with the
porting, you can ask on IRC (#fedora-python on Freenode), or reply here.
We'll be happy to help!
